a+b=c
num1=num2=sum
// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
a/2=1 or 0
num1/2= remender
if remender =1 print Odd
else remender = 0 print even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.  
5 seperate numbers
num1,num2,num3,num4,num5 
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
the average of five number is sum of n number devided by total number
(num1+num2+num3+num4+num5)/5
print the reasult "this is average "
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
minimum= num1
for each number in numbers 
if number< minimum
print minimum= "this is minimum number"
maximum = num1
if number > maximum
maximum = number 
print maximum = 'This is maximum number"

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
print on screen numerical value and " Average of numbers listed"
print on screen "minimum value" and "maximum vale" from the  listed numbers
